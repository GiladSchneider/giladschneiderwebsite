                Hi! I am graduating from <a href="https://www.rutgers.edu/" target=”_blank”>Rutgers University</a> in May with a dual degree in Computer Science and Mathematics.
                <br>
                <br>
                Last year, I worked on an ecommerce platform for canabbis dispensaries at a startup called Greentree.
                <br>
                <br>
                Before that, I spent a year researching neural network memory compression and training acceleration under <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/samanzonouz4n6/saman-zonouz?authuser=0" target=”_blank”>Dr. Saman Zonouz</a>.
                <br>
                <br>
                I like to powerlift, read(slowly), cook, play board games, and spend time on other enjoyable activities with fat tailed payoffs.
